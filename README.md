### Yo!

#### about
Yo. If you are new here, welcome! My name is TGB and I'm a software engineer (at a start up in the Silicon Valley), addicted console gamer (think Modern Warfare, Halo, MGS5, Last of Us, Pokemon, etc.), and avid distance-runner (10k 8:10/mi pace). I've recently become interested in game development so I'll be keeping track of my progress through making videos on this YouTube channel. I'll try my best to stick to a weekly schedule! Stay tuned; like and subscribe :P
