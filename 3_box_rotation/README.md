Devlog 03 // How to Rotate 2D Objects in Unity

//description
Yo, this is my first run with unity! I have no prior experience coding in C# so I had a lot of learning to do. I was initially going to do a test run by making flappy bird in Unity, but just understanding the basics took me the whole weekend. Hope ya'll enjoy this video on how to make rigidbody2d (squares or boxes) rotate.

//tasks
- Get square objects to be displayed on screen
- Ensure that objects are by adding rigidbody2d and boxcollider2d
- Add falling script (adding 2d rigid body does this for us!)
- Add rotation to box
  - first we need to our box to bounce when we hit spacebar
  - we need to rotate left/right when hitting spacebar
    - first just rotate (done)
    - second toggle rotate right/left when spacebar is hit

//topics learned
- Unity
- Rigidbody2D
- MoveRotation
- Input.GetKey
- Input.GetKeyDown
- StartCoroutine
- StopCoroutine
- IEnumerator
- yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.0001f); ??

Yo. If you are new here, welcome! My name is TGB and I'm a software engineer (at a start up in the Silicon Valley), addicted console gamer (think Modern Warfare, Halo, MGS5, Last of Us, Pokemon, etc.), and avid distance-runner (10k 8:10/mi pace). I've recently become interested in game development so I'll be keeping track of my progress through making videos on this YouTube channel. I'll try my best to stick to a weekly schedule! Stay tuned; like and subscribe :P
