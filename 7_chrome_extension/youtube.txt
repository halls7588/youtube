I often found myself opening IMDb to check reviews before starting a new Netflix tv-show or movie. After finally getting fed-up with the sub-optimal process, I built this chrome extension. Now, I don't have to open numerous tabs to search through reviews anymore! In this video, I will be taking you through the step-by-step process of making this Netflix extension.

Note: If you are completely new to chrome extensions, then I would advise that you start off by watching the chrome extensions series on YouTube made by `the coding train`. I used his videos as a starting point.
