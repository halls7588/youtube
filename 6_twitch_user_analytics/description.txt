Data Sciene 101: Analyzing Twitch Viewership Data in Python

// Quick Blurb
Yo, I decided to make a quick project with python again since running Unity on my 4 y/o Mac was not ideal. This time, I made a tool that helps you analyze twitch user-video data. We use the Python requests library to make calls to the Twitch API and display the information with d3.js charts. Hope y'all enjoy!

// About
Yo. If you are new here, welcome! My name is TGB and I'm a software engineer (at a start up in the Silicon Valley), addicted console gamer (think Modern Warfare, Halo, Pokemon, etc.), and avid distance-runner (10k 8:10/mi pace). I've recently become interested in building small projects and I'll be keeping track of my progress through making videos on this YouTube channel. I make new videos every month! Stay tuned; like and subscribe :P
