Finally Committed, An Asinine Introduction

Yo, my name is Telugu Gameboy (aka TGB) and I’m a software engineer and avid gamer in the San Francisco Bay Area - this is my YouTube channel.

I recently started full-time work as a software engineer at a bay area start-up (cash money), and noticed that I’ve been having a bit of free time on my hands. In this free time, I’ve been messing around with a few things here and there - learning the piano, waking up at 7am to hit the gym, wanking with my left hand - things I’ve never really done before.

After some thought, I’ve finally decided to CoMmIt, to YOU-Tube. I’m not sure exactly what will be of this channel when I decided, but I knew I needed a way to let my creative side do some werk. Once I got into the groove and felt good vibes from work, I wanted to expand a bit more and still learn new skills while I grind on the 9-5, cashing in on that bread.

So… what can you expect?

I’m planning on a weekly schedule, where I drop the hottest shit - software engineering, data science, running or gaming related. I tend to accumulate a bit of knowledge every week and I wanted to FLEX it to all ya’ll YouTube plebs.

Most importantly, I want to show all ya’ll the amount of work it takes to make a (soon to be) successful YT channel. You can track my weekly progress on the GitHub account where I will keep track of all the work I do. If ya’ll interested in seeing more, like and subscribe and turn on dem notifs.

C-ya soon - bishes.
